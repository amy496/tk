1. What is Git and how is it different from Github?

Git is described as a "version control system" mainly used by programmers who code. A Git repository stores and keeps track of the changes that are made to code on your computer.
It allows for different users to work on the same code simultaneously and for those merged changes to be tracked as well. Github is a website that enables users to upload 
their Git repos online. Github provides a backup of files, gives the user a visual for their repos, and allows for easier collaboration within teams working on the same project.

2. Why use the terminal?

The terminal is used because it allows the programmer to "talk" directly to the computer rather than through the graphical user interface(GUI). It is more efficient for
working on projects and is expected to be used as a tech professional.


3. Explain 3 benefits of version control in your own words.

Version control keeps tracks of changes made to code by multiple users in a central location. This can allow for projects to be completed in quicker time. This is also beneficial because it gives the programmer a form of reference when applying particular code.
A programmer can examine the changes and improve on what was done before or if a code does not work a programmer can retrace their steps and look at where they went wrong to fix it.
